# Snake Game
This is a Python project that implements the classic Snake game using the Turtle module. The game allows the user to control a snake and eat food, with the snake growing longer with each food eaten. If the snake hits a wall or itself, the game ends.

# Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the project files from this GitHub repository.

# Usage
To run the game, navigate to the directory where the project files are saved in your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

# Copy code
python snake_game.py This will run the Python script and open a window with the game board.

# How It Works
The project uses the Turtle module to create the game board, snake, and food. It defines functions to handle user input, move the snake, and detect collisions. The game loop updates the screen and handles user input until the game ends.

# Turtle Circle Drawing Module (Spyrograph)

This is a Python Turtle module that draws 36 circles around a central point, each with a different color and angle.

# Installation

To run this module, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can use the code provided in your Python script or IDE.

# Usage

To use this module, simply copy and paste the code into your Python script or IDE and run it. The module will draw 36 circles around a central point with a random color and angle.

# How It Works

The module uses the Turtle module to create a turtle object and define functions to generate a random color. Then, a for loop is used to draw 36 circles around a central point, each at a different angle and with a random color.

# Random Turtle Movements

This is a Python Turtle project that uses the Turtle module to create a turtle object that moves in random directions and changes colors.

# Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the project files from this GitHub repository.

# Usage

To run the project, navigate to the directory where the project files are saved in your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

# Copy code

python random_turtle_movements.py
This will run the Python script and open a window with the turtle moving in random directions and changing colors.

# How It Works

The project uses the Turtle module to create a turtle object and define functions to generate a random angle, distance, and color. Then, a for loop is used to make the turtle move in random directions and change colors 100 times.
